//! The [`Platform`] and [`OutputWakeup`] contracts, exercised only through
//! the traits.
//!
//! Every test here is generic over `P: Platform` and is handed
//! [`CurrentPlatform`], so what is asserted is the contract each operating
//! system has to meet rather than the one this build happens to compile. A
//! platform added later is covered by these the moment it is named here.
//!
//! Two methods are deliberately absent. [`Platform::fork_pty`] forks the
//! process, and a child returning into the test harness would run the suite a
//! second time; [`Platform::close_fds_from`] closes every descriptor at or
//! above its argument, which in a test process includes the harness's own.
//! Both are documented `unsafe` with exactly that caller obligation, so
//! neither is a contract a test process can hold up its end of.
