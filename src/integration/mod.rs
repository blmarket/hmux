//! Prototype consumers of the native runtime observability contracts.
//!
//! A single background [`AgentObserver`] polls pane observability and classifies
//! each pane's agent lifecycle state. Detection is split into a generic harness
//! (this module) and per-agent [`AgentDetector`]s (e.g. [`codex`], [`claude`],
//! and [`pi`]),
//! so adding an agent is a matter of adding a detector rather than another
//! poller. Running one observer with a detector registry — instead of one thread
//! per agent — avoids two observers fighting over the same pane, and matches how
//! Herdr identifies a pane's agent once and then reads only that agent's UI.
