//! The tiling layout: the panes divide the window between them, and nothing
//! extends past it. A fixed rule over the pane list places them: the first
//! pane takes the window, and each next pane splits the previous pane's
//! rectangle in two, the earlier pane keeping the first half. The first split
//! is along the window's longer side; the splits after it alternate, so a wide
//! window does not end up as one row of narrow columns.
