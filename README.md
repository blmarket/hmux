# hmux

hmux is a **tmux-compatible** server built for the people who work with coding

agents. All you get is almost tmux, with rich agent integrations as a plus.

It speaks tmux's own wire protocols, with the standard `tmux attach`
intended as the main client communicating with this server.

## What agent control? Why?

It recognize and provide basic agent stuff via tmux placeholders, only when the
existing tmux control plane does not support the feature necessary for agent
control. See ./agentmon/ to see an example agent integration.

## Why not tmux, cmux, or herdr?

- tmux is de facto standard of terminal multiplexer, broadly available.
  - But agent integration can greatly improved with native code, which hmux
    tries to achieve.
- cmux tries to replace your terminal (e.g. Alacritty, Ghostty)
  - Need to replace whole your terminal application stacks with cmux. hmux can
    be a good alternative if you prefer smaller change for agents.
- herdr tries to replace tmux with better agent integrations
  - Hard to co-exist with tmux and limited flexibility on agent control UX. hmux
    can be a good alternative if you prefer to define your own agent control.

Basic hmux setup - one window running agentmon for orchestration, can have terminal
apps + agents either by agentmon or directly.
