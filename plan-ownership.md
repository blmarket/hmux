# Execute incremental ownership migration in hmux2

Migrate the easiest remaining ownership boundaries first, preserving behavior,
identity, and destruction semantics. Executing this prompt means making and
validating production code changes, not merely producing another inventory or a
proposal. Creating this document alone does not execute it.

## Agreed type policy

Choose the simplest type justified by actual ownership and aliasing:

| Existing role | Preferred representation |
| --- | --- |
| Owned NUL-terminated string | `CString` |
| Borrowed NUL-terminated string | `&CStr` |
| Owned object without escaping weak references | `Box<T>`, or inline `T` when indirection is unnecessary |
| Owned object with escaping non-owning references | `RefBox<T>` at the owner and `refbox::Weak<T>` at observers |
| Temporary access | `&T` / `&mut T` with scoped lifetimes |
| Object with an existing explicit tmux reference count | Consider `Rc<T>` only after auditing its existing retain/release semantics |
| Owned bytes or elements | `Vec<T>`, boxed slices, or an appropriate standard collection |
| Borrowed bytes or elements | Slices |
| Legitimately absent value | `Option` of the appropriate type |

- Do not introduce generational handles, replacement object-ID registries, or
  new identity semantics. Preserve existing numeric IDs and indexes.
- Do not put everything in `RefBox`. Prefer ordinary ownership when references
  do not escape. A temporary raw pointer for a synchronous C call does not, by
  itself, require `RefBox`.
- Do not introduce `Rc` or `Arc` for objects without an existing reference
  count. An existing counter is a reason to investigate `Rc`, not proof that
  its semantics match. Document which operations retain and release ownership.
- Required weak access must assert that the target is alive, with a useful
  invariant message. Do not silently filter, skip, or default expired links.
  Inspect the installed refbox API: use its checked access/borrow equivalent
  when it has no `upgrade()` method. Treat borrow conflicts as bugs to resolve,
  not reasons to fall back to unchecked pointers. A failure may reveal a tmux
  bug or a migration bug; investigate both.
- Represent intentional absence explicitly. Remove observers at the proper
  teardown point rather than making expired weak references normal control flow.
- Keep strings byte-preserving. Do not assume UTF-8, add lossy conversion, or
  change embedded-NUL handling. Preserve null versus empty where observable.

## Start by finding the easiest current target

- Locally owned temporary strings that are created, used synchronously, and
  freed in the same operation. Check whether all consumers only borrow them.
- Small leaf records with one allocation/free pair and no retained observers.
- Detached parser scratch buffers, argument-conversion temporaries, and simple
  leaf strings in layout, JSON, format, or message code. Audit each actual
  lifetime; these modules are not presumed uniformly easy.
- The pane resize queue in `src/shared/pane.rs`, `src/window.rs`,
  `src/server_client.rs`, and `src/screen_write.rs`. It already uses boxed
  storage, so select it only if completing its lifetime removes meaningful
  manual ownership. Its callback-adjacent cleanup makes it a later candidate
  than a genuinely local string or leaf object.
- Session/winlink ownership already has partial `RefBox` support. Defer this
  graph work while simpler `CString`/`Box` targets remain.

## Implement one complete boundary at a time

1. Trace every creation, mutation, ownership transfer, alias, and destruction
   path for the selected allocation, including errors and early returns.
2. Introduce the chosen Rust owner and migrate its actual production callers.
   Remove obsolete manual frees, counts/capacities, and pointer manipulation
   where the new type supplies those responsibilities. Prefer safe operations
   with private owner fields over public raw-pointer accessors.
3. Try to preserve allocation / deallocation at a single migration - if we
   migrate one allocation, corresponding deallocation should be also migrated
   at the same commit. As compiler / runtime does not break for mixed C/Rust
   alloc/deallocs (internally they both use the same malloc/free pair), it
   should be your reasoning instead of test based.
4. Audit the containing record before adding a drop-bearing field. `repr(C)`
   alone is not the obstacle: `Copy`, bitwise copies, zero initialization,
   `xcalloc`, `realloc`, and `free` can bypass Rust invariants and destruction.
   Change that whole lifecycle together, or select a smaller target. Remove
   `Copy` when ownership moves into a record. Do not add a custom `Drop` while
   leaving its only destruction path as libc `free`.
5. Preserve required ABI signatures and layouts during a bounded increment.
   Distinguish genuine foreign boundaries from translated internal conventions;
   internal Rust APIs may change with all callers and relevant contracts.
   Keep any necessary compatibility raw pointer private or narrowly exposed,
   document its owner and invalidation rule, and keep unsafe conversion local.
   Merely renaming a raw pointer to `NonNull` or wrapping an existing collection
   without eliminating a manual lifetime responsibility is insufficient.
6. Preserve pointee address stability when aliases depend on it. Never turn
   shared/reentrant raw access into an unrestricted `&mut T`. End Rust borrows
   before callbacks, hooks, or destruction that can reenter the same object.
   Do not extend a borrow's lifetime or add unchecked interior mutability to
   get the conversion compiling.
7. Preserve destruction and notification order, cancellation, traversal order,
   duplicate-key behavior, and existing reference-count lifetime extensions.
   Changes exposed by a failing invariant require investigation and regression
   coverage, not weakening the assertion.

## Continue and leave a resumable result

Unless the invocation specifies another scope, complete up to three small,
independently validated ownership migrations per execution. Re-rank after each
one: prefer the next simple owner rather than expanding into a difficult parent
graph. Finish the current boundary and its validation before starting another.
If a candidate requires a broad redesign, record why it was deferred and pick
an easier independent candidate. Do not stop after discovery when an actionable
small target exists. If no small target remains, document the evidence and the
smallest prerequisite for the next migration rather than forcing a large rewrite.

Update the execution log below after each completed increment. Include concrete
source symbols, removed manual ownership responsibilities, tests/results, and
remaining compatibility pointers. Keep the next-candidate list current so a
later invocation resumes from source reality without repeating completed work.
Do not commit, push, or publish unless separately instructed.

The final response must identify what actually migrated, why these were the
easiest targets, validation results and limitations, and the next easiest target.
Do not claim all raw pointers are gone or that a safe wrapper proves unexamined
legacy callers safe.

## Execution log

No implementation increments executed yet. On first execution, inspect the
current source and rank candidates before choosing the first migration.
